1) Here are 3 psuedo-code algorithms that one might use in real life:

 A) RINSE
    LATHER
    REPEAT
    (hahahaha I couldn't resist)

 A) Factorial PUSH-UPs (starting_number)
    SET push_up_count equal to starting_number 
    
    WHILE push_up_count is greater than zero
        FOR number in push_up_count
            DO push up
        ENDFOR
        DECREMENT push_up_count by one
    ENDWHILE
    
 B) DRINK WATER
    GET container of water
    
    IF container is sealed
        DO open container
    ENDIF
    
    DO bring container opening to mouth
    DO tilt container so water flows from container to mouth
    
    WHILE container still has water in it
        DO keep container tilted 
        (maybe add a integral function to determine the required tilt angle)
    ENDWHILE
 
 C) Wax on | Wax off
    GET sponge is left hand
    GET rag in right hand
    
    WHILE the sun is still in the sky
        DO dip sponge in wax container
        
        DO apply wax in counter-clockwise motion
        DO rub-in wax with rag using clockwise motion
        
        DO breathe!
    ENDWHILE
