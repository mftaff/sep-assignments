This algorithm returns so so results. here are the paths taken:

jlem
tlv
haifa
eilat
~~~~~~~
haifa
tlv
jlem
eilat
~~~~~~~
tlv
jlem
haifa
eilat
~~~~~~~
eilat
jlem
tlv
haifa

when starting from haifa or eilat the algorithm did find the best route (which makes
sense because those were edge cities which should be easier to trace a path through)

however, from tlv or jlem, I found more accurate solutions:

From Jlem:
algorithm's choice : jlem-tlv-haifa-eilat = 55+86+363 = 504
best choice        : jlem-haifa-tlv-eilat = 119+86+280 = 485

From Tlv:
algorithm's choice : tlv-jlem-haifa-eilat = 55+119+363 = 537
best choice        : tlv-haifa-jlem-eilat = 86+119+248 = 453
