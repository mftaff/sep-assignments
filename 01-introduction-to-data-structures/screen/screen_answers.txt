Most of this was straitforward. for a matrix, I had some trouble using rubies 
built-in matrix so I just created one out of arrays: 

self.matrix = Array.new(height) { |arr| Array.new(width) }

this worked perfectly well. also as it defaulted all of the positions to nil
it satisfied the 4th spec by default.
