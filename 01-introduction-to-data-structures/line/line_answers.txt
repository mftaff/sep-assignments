For line.join:

It seemed simple enough to just append new people to the end of the 
members array. I also added a call to a private function in order to verify that the
person variable is a proper Person object.

For line.leave:

Originally I was using the built-in .delete but after checking the docs: 
https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html#method-i-delete It seemed like a lot
of code was being run, so I went ahead a wrote a (hopefully) simpler loop.

We can use a binary search!! using the index of member!!
