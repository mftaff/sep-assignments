1)

My data structure allows developers to access and manipulate data in the following way. 
By creating a class (a Line class or a Screen class etc) we create a system of 
storing data in an expandable, manageable, but most importantly non-locked in way. 

Using a class with methods/attributes allows one a framework to handle data. So for 
example in the line example, if their are 20 amusement park rides, each with it's 
own line, we can easily store/update/view the data for each line, by creating a class
for each. This takes our data (a list of people in a line) and empowers it with methods
like search join leave etc.


2)

To search for data in our examples we could use either the lineInstance.search(person) or 
screenInstance.at(x,y)


3)

The line data structure could represent any kind of queue not just an amusement
park ride. As a principle though (if you change what the line contains) than it 
can be used for things like assembly line management, or Airplanes lining up for takeoff.

The screen data structure is essentially a matrix. The uses for matrices seem to be 
quite vast. However, some simple examples could be plotting points on a map, or 
other similar node/plots uses.
