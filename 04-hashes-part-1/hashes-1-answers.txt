It seems that choosing to arbitrarily double the size of an array is not very
efficient. In simple terms this is because our hash algorithm is as follows:

take ascii value of key divide by array size take remainder

However if the array size is anything but a prime number than it is going to
generate duplicates rather often. On top of that having it as an even number allows
it to always be divisible by 2, which further ensures that it will create 
duplicates. 

In our example the numbers are as follows:

with 6 total entries we have this pattern:

array size = 6  we store 2 items
collision on item 3
array size = 12 we store 2
collistion on item 3
array size = 24 we store 6 items

this means that our array is 4 times bigger than it needs to be. This is not a 
good alocation of resources.
